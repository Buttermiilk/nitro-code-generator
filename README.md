<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Actually uh this is a learning project, you shouldn't attempt to try this if you don't have the patience. As mentioned above the chances for getting a key is extremely low, you probably would mark this as not working.

But if you have the passion to actually choose me and try this:
* A lot of the repos out there do this the incorrect way (either to spam the API to get a 17-hour ratelimit like me or to misunderstand things). The point of this repo is to fix that.
* If you try this, be sure to spend ~~some time~~ a few weeks looking at it because of that super small chance I mentioned. Well, that's what you get for brute-forcing.
* Code's fairly simple. Like, look, there are only 2 files that you need to care about.

I'll make sure to ruin your entire day with this, heheh.

Scroll down to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

It's... believe me, very simple. You can just get rolling by a few steps.

### Prerequisites

Get [Python](https://python.org) and [git Command Line Interface](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). We'll use Python 3.8 for this tutorial.

### Installation

Clone this repo using this command in your terminal.
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Buttermiilk/nitro-code-generator.git
  ```

Check if `requirements.txt` exists first, then use this command on the same directory.
  ```sh
  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Fill in a Discord channel Webhook URL in `main.py` at line 10. If you don't know what this is, leave the file as it is.
  ```py
  "WebHook_URL": "Your URL Here"
  ```

After you've done everything right, use this command in your terminal.
  ```sh
  python3 main.py
  ```
Follow the instructions given, and you're good to go.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

* To waste your time.
* Sit there and wait until `200 response | Valid Code` pops up in your terminal.
* Paste the URL in your desired browser, and enjoy. It could be painful, though.
